# Color Extractor

Simple module to extract the "average" color from an image a la https://manu.ninja/dominant-colors-for-lazy-loading-images

Currently trying two different methods, one using graphicsmagick and another with Canvas.

They're both fairly successful at guessing colors though both methods struggle with while objects.

Try adjusting color array for better results.
